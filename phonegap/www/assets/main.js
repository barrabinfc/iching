Creative",trigrams:{above:{title:"chien",description:"THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN"},below:{title:"chien",description:"THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN"}},interpretation:{oracle:"\n\n	THE CREATIVE works sublime success,\n	Furthering through perseverance.",resume:"\n\nThe first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines \nstand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the \nspirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is \nwithout weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its \nenergy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is \ntherefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this \nmotion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power \nof persisting in time, that is, duration.\n\n  The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense \nin terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. \nIn relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action \nof the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of \nthe holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power \nawakens and develops their higher nature.\n	",judgment:'\n\nAccording to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of \nsuccess, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual \ndraws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal \ndepths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his \nhappiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what \nis right.\n\n  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of \nspeculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime" \nmeans literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in \nexplaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings \nowe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven." For this \nattribute inheres in the other three as well.\n\n  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that \nhave yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend \nform to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and \nthe process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the \nrain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."\n\n  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to \nnotable success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he \ncompletes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them \nat the right time, as though on sic dragons." The six steps are the six different \npositions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon \nsymbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and \ngiving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running \nthrough end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each \nstep attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer \na hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.\n\n  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity \nand success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous \nactualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms \n"furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a \ngiven being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of \nthe Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific \nnature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus \ndoes it show itself to further through perseverance."\n\n  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace \nand security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers \nhigh above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."\n\n  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words \n"sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with \nthe four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the \nfundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the \nattribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize \nexpressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute \nfurthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which \neach receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and \nwhich constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated \nwith wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can \ntherefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already \nbroached in the commentary called Wên Yen , later formed the bridge \nconnecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid \ndown in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of \nChanges, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative \nprinciples. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of \nthought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.\n	',image:{oracle:"The movement of heaven is full of power. \n	Thus the superior man makes himself strong and \n	untiring.",image:"Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which \nheaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete \nrevolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means \nthat each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is \nthe same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea \nof duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor \nslackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This \nduration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative. \n  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so \nthat his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way, \nby consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains \nthat tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his \nactivity.\n		"},lines:[{poem:"Nine at the beginning means:\nHidden dragon. Do not act.",expl:"In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again.  Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe."},{poem:"Nine in the second place means:\nDragon appearing in the field.\nIt furthers one to see the great man.",expl:"Here the effects of the light-giving power begin to manifest themselves.

Such a man is destined to gain great influence and to set the world in order.

There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and remains blameless."},{poem:"Nine in the fourth place means:\nWavering flight over the depths.\nNo blame.",expl:"A place of transition has been reached, and free choice can enter in.

The broken lines represents \nthe dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the \nhexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of \nTHE CREATIVE—the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does \nnot combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to \nspirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal \nas against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the \nprinciple of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation \nbetween man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and \nbetween father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears \nin the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.\n\n  But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly \ndefined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course \nthe Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of \ndevotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the \nCreative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it \nis productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand \nas an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result \nthen is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of \nevil to both.\n	",judgment:'\n\nThe four fundamental aspects of the Creative—"sublime success, furthering \nthrough perseverance"—are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however, \nthe perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive \nconnotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. \nThe potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a \nspecifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here \nadded to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the \ndragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a \nsymbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because \nthe mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the \ngentleness and devotion of the cow.\n\n  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad \nimpulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature\'s richness \nlies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to \ngive then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the \nCreative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. \nApplied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in \nconformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an \nindependent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must \nachieve something. It is not his task to try to lead—that would only make him \nlose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an \nattitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man \nlets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the \nsituation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from \nfate.\n\n  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in \nthe hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The \ntime of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south \nsymbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature \ndoes in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all \none\'s powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find \nfriends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and \neffort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The \neast symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and \nthe north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he \nmust be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without \ncompanions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional \nhates and favoritism.\n	',image:{oracle:"	The earth's condition is receptive devotion.\n	Thus the superior man who has breadth of character\n	Carries the outer world.",image:"\n\nJust as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the \nhexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, \nbut in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension \nin space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things \nthat live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good \nand evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his \ncharacter breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to \nsupport and to bear with people and things.\n		"},lines:[{poem:"Six at the beginning means:\nWhen there is hoarfrost underfoot,\nSolid ice is not far off.",expl:"Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy, represents death. When the first hoarfrost comes in the autumn, the power of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here.  In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes.

Thus squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.  Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions.

It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light-giving \npower must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be a germ of life \nwithin, if life is to be awakened.

The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before \nits influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as \nintractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of \nsuccess depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid \noneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act \non one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, \nunderstand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been opened, \nthe force of one's personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no \nobstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous \nthings, such as crossing the great water, and succeed.\n\n  But it is important to understand upon what the force inner truth depends. \nThis force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond. Close ties \nmay exist also among thieves; it is true that such a bond acts as a force but, \nsince it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune. All association on \nthe basis of common interests holds only up to a certain point.

In ancient \nChina, the entire administration of justice was guided by this principle. A \ndeep understanding that knows how to pardon was considered the highest \nform of justice.

In this way inner peace and the force of inner truth are lost."},{poem:"Nine in the second place means:\nA crane calling in the shade.\nIts young answers it.\nI have a good goblet.\nI will share it with you.",expl:"This refers to the involuntary influence of a man's inner being upon persons of kindred spirit. The crane need not show itself on a high hill. It may be quite hidden when it sounds its call; yet its young will hear its not, will recognize it and give answer. Where there is a joyous mood, there a comrade will appear to share a glass of wine.  This is the echo awakened in men through spiritual attraction. Whenever a feeling is voiced with truth and frankness, whenever a deed is the clear expression of sentiment, a mysterious and far-reaching influence is exerted. At first it acts on those who are inwardly receptive. But the circle grows larger and larger. The root of all influence lies in one's own inner being: given true and vigorous expression in word and deed, its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection of something that emanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate intention of an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it. Confucius says about this line:The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken, he meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! If the superior man abides in his room and his words are not well spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! Words go forth from one's own person and exert their influence on men. Deeds are born close at hand and become visible far away. Words and deeds are the hinge and bowspring of the superior man. As hinge and bowspring move, they bring honor or disgrace. Through words and deeds the superior man moves heaven and earth . Must one not, then, be cautious?"},{poem:"Six in the third place means:\nHe finds a comrade.\nNow he beats the drum, now he stops.\nNow he sobs, now he sings.",expl:"Here the source of a man's strength lies not in himself but in his relation to other people. No matter how close to them he may be, if his center of gravity depends on them, he is inevitably tossed to and fro between joy and sorrow. Rejoicing to high heaven, then sad unto death-this is the fate of those who depend upon an inner accord with other persons whom they love. Here we have only the statement of the law that this is so. Whether this condition is felt to be an affliction of the supreme happiness of love, is left to the subjective verdict of the person concerned."},{poem:"Six in the fourth place means:\nThe moon nearly at the full.\nThe team horse goes astray.\nNo blame.",expl:"To intensify the power of inner truth, a man must always turn to his superior, from whom he can receive enlightenment as the moon receives light form the sun.

Just as on the one hand we must be humble and reverent when face to face with the source of enlightenment, so likewise must we on the other renounce factionalism among men.

She ventures rather to approach the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex. Hence here deviation from the rule is not a mistake.  Another image is that of the official who, in compliance with regulation, first seeks an audience with his prince. If he is not successful in this, he does not try to force anything but goes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking his place among the other officials.
